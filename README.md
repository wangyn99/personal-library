personal-library
================

An example .
It is a small personal library.
Has been deployed on  lentbook.meteor.com.
You can sign in with username: admin, password: 123456
You can edit books' categories, books' names, persons the books lent to.
The application may have some difference with the original one, and may also have some problems.
I'll check it later.
